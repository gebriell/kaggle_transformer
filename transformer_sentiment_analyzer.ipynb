looks much better. We see that each rating class is sufficiently represented, and we can expect to get a more well-rounded analyzer. While this is a good way to even things out, our model can still be biased due to the reviews themselves. People leave comments when they have stronger opinions about a product. This is why balancing the types of reviews we give our model is necessary, so that the model can get a complete representation of the range of opinions**\n","\n","**We will also encounter things like typos, improper punctuation and spacing, along with other grammatical issues.

Our reviews contain things like punctuations that we don't need to work with.

My fiancee sent me to the store with \"advice\" to pick up a bottle of Dove unscented bodywash.<br /><br />Turns out Dove unscented, isn't; at least, not exactly.<br /><br />We found that out the next morning as I was getting ready. Despite the \"unscented\" label, while using the bodywash in the shower, the stuff has a very heavy fragrance, not really any different in strength than my usual Denali. So...Wasn't too surprised to get out of the shower only to find my fiancee on the other side of the apartment and every single balcony door open.<br /><br />That being said, the scent did seem to dissipate quickly and left only a faint odor after 15 minutes and no detectable scent within 30, but still.<br /><br />After a call to Unilever, customer service told me what April discovered. Namely, that the unscented bodywash did contain a fragrance (malfa or malta or something like that), but it was intended only to mask/neutralize the natural odors of the ingredients and definitely shouldn't have come across as a \"heavy\" odor in use, so...<br /><br />I don't know if we just wound up with a bad bottle or if that's just how the stuff works/smells, but. It obviously wouldn't work for our needs, so I'm back to basics with a plain, unscented bar of soap. \n","\n","['just', 'to', 'start', 'with', 'i', \"'m\", 'typically', 'not', 'the', 'type', 'to',

This mechanism, often referred to as self-attention, has been a transformative development in NLP. It serves as a way to allocate \"focus\" or \"attention\" values to the different embedded vectors that pass through the model's embedding layer. This allocation is achieved by segmenting the input vectors into three key components: queries, keys, and values.**\n","\n","**The process begins with the transformation of the input embeddings into three distinct matrices: the Query matrix (Q), Key matrix (K), and Value matrix (V). These matrices are obtained through linear transformations of the original embeddings.**\n","\n","**The heart of the attention mechanism involves calculating dot products between the Query matrix and the Transposed Key matrix. The resulting dot products are then scaled by the square root of the dimension of the key vectors. This scaling factor plays a crucial role in maintaining stable gradients during training.**\n","\n","**The next step in the process employs a softmax operation on the scaled dot products. The softmax function normalizes the values, converting them into attention weights. These attention weights indicate the \"importance\" or \"weight\" assigned to each word in relation to the others. The summation of the attention weights for each query-key pair ensures that the model focuses on the most relevant information.**\n","\n","**The weighted sum of the Value matrix, determined by the attention weights, generates an attended representation. In essence, the attention mechanism enables the model to capture the contextual relationships between words, determining how much each word contributes to the overall understanding of the sequence.**\n","\n","**One innovation that distinguishes the Transformer architecture is multi-head attention. Instead of relying on a single attention mechanism, multiple parallel attention mechanisms, or \"heads,\" are employed. Each head attends to the input independently and learns different aspects of the relationships between words. The outputs of the different heads are concatenated and linearly transformed, resulting in a comprehensive representation that encompasses various perspectives on the input data.**\n","\n","**Example:**\n","\n","**Consider the sentence: \"Diana wanted to visit Seattle in the Winter, but was ill-prepared for the cold, Pacific Northwest weather.\"**\n","\n","**In this sentence, the attention mechanism discerns connections between words, prioritizing specific words when analyzing others.

attention allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously, capturing multiple relationships and dependencies.\n","\n","Let's break down the code:\n","\n","1. The `MultiHeadedAttention` class is defined as a subclass of `nn.Module`, indicating that it is a PyTorch module.\n","\n","2. The `__init__` method is the constructor of the class and takes three parameters:\n","   - `h`: The number of attention heads.\n","   - `d_model`: The dimensionality of the model (embedding size).\n","   - `dropout`: The dropout probability for regularization.\n","\n","3. Inside the constructor:\n","   - The dimension of each attention head `d_k` is calculated as `d_model // h`.\n","   - Four linear layers are created using `nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)` and stored in `self.linears` as a `nn.ModuleList`. These linear layers are used for transforming the query, key, value, and output.\n","   - A dropout layer is created using `nn.Dropout` with the specified dropout probability.\n","\n","4. The `scaled_dot_product_attention` method is defined as a static method to compute the scaled dot-product attention:\n","   - It takes the query, key, value, and optional mask and dropout as input.\n","   - The dot product of the query and key is computed using `torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1))`, and then scaled by dividing by the square root of `d_k`.\n","   - If a mask is provided, the scores are masked by setting the masked positions to negative infinity using `scores.masked_fill(mask == 0, float('-inf'))`.\n","   - The attention weights are computed by applying a softmax function to the scores using `torch.softmax(scores, dim=-1)`.\n","   - If dropout is provided, it is applied to the attention weights.\n","   - The attended values are computed by multiplying the attention weights with the value using `torch.matmul(p_attn, value)`.\n","   - The method returns the attended values and the attention weights.\n","\n","5. The `forward` method is defined to compute the output of the multi-head attention module:\n","   - It takes the query, key, value, and optional mask as input.\n","   - The input tensors are transformed using the linear layers stored in `self.linears`, reshaped to have dimensions `(nbatches, -1, h, d_k)`, and transposed to have dimensions `(nbatches, h, -1, d_k)`.\n","   - The `scaled_dot_product_attention` method is called with the transformed query, key, value, mask, and dropout to compute the attended values and attention weights.\n","   - The attended values are reshaped back to have dimensions `(nbatches, -1, h * d_k)` by transposing and contiguous view.\n","   - The output is obtained by passing the reshaped attended values through the last linear layer in `self.linears`.\n","\n","In summary, the `MultiHeadedAttention` module implements the multi-head attention mechanism, which allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously. It splits the input into multiple attention heads, performs scaled dot-product attention on each head, and then concatenates and transforms the attended values to produce the final output."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f79db2e5","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.023856,"end_time":"2024-05-21T06:37:49.621199","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-05-21T06:37:49.597343","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["![Self-Attention

The hiker is the set of model parameters, which are being updated with each step (iteration). SGD is like the GPS for the hiker, helping it navigate toward the lowest point in the valley (i.e. the global minimum of the loss function) with each step. The key difference is that SGD is an iterative process that updates the parameters in small steps, rather than finding the global minimum in a single shot. The learning rate is essentially the \"speed limit\" for the hiker (the model parameters). The learning rate would be how far the GPS would tell the hiker to go before it iterates/updates. A higher learning rate means that the hiker can make larger updates to the parameters with each step, while a lower learning rate means that the updates are smaller. This is important because it determines not only how quickly the model can find the global minimum, but also how stable the descent is - if the learning rate is too high, the hiker could get lost in the valley, but if it's too low, it could take forever to reach the bottom. So, the learning rate controls the speed of the descent and helps the model find the optimal set of parameters without overshooting or taking too long.\n","\n","Some additional points to augment the analogy:\n","\n","The terrain can be rugged with many hills, valleys, and obstacles - like the high-dimensional, non-convex loss function landscape.\n","\n","Momentum in SGD helps the hiker build up speed in consistently downhill directions, like momentum in GD.\n","\n","Adaptive LR is like the GPS dynamically recommending faster or slower speeds depending on terrain.\n","\n","Regularization is like constraining the hiker's path to stay on trails and avoid dangerous cliffs (to prevent overfitting).\n","\n","Batch size is like the number of hikers traversing together (to average gradient noise).\n","\n","Epochs are like hiking to the bottom, then restarting from the top to repeat the descent.\n","\n","Early stopping is like stopping the hike once you reach a good enough point close to the valley floor.\n","\n","Hyperparameter tuning is like tweaking the GPS settings for optimal navigation.\n","\n","Vanishing gradients are like certain paths becoming too steep or hitting dead-ends.\n","\n","Local minima: The terrain can be rugged with many local minima, which are small valleys that are not as deep as the global minimum. SGD can get stuck in local minima, but there are various techniques that can help to avoid this, such as momentum and adaptive learning rate.\n","\n","Learning rate schedule: The learning rate can be adjusted over time to improve the performance of SGD. This is known as a learning rate schedule. For example, the learning rate can be decreased as the model converges to the global minimum, in order to prevent overshooting.\n","\n","Noise: The gradient calculation can be noisy, especially when the batch size is small. This can cause SGD to take a more erratic path towards the global minimum. However, the noise can be averaged out by using a larger batch size."]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"gpu","dataSources":[{"datasetId":6763,"sourceId":9801,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"},{"datasetId":1461623,"sourceId":2415872,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":30527,"isGpuEnabled":true,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.12"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":5854.381559,"end_time":"2024-05-21T06:46:13.433159","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2024-05-21T05:08:39.0516","version":"2.4.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
