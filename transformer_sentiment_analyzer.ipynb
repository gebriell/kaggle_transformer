To get rid of these, we use regular expressions to filter them out, and convert every character to lowercase to achieve uniformity.**\n","\n","**Something else we can do is a process called Lemmatization. This is the process of replacing variants of a word by the base word itself. An example of this would be to change the words knew, knowing, and known to their base word: know.

I opened my water bottle. It doesn't say you cannot do this, in fact on the bottle itself it does show 2 kinds of water bottles, both with their tops off.<br /><br />Then the liquid squirts out of the bottle, onto my counter, which by the way you will need Soft Scrub or some kind of cleanser to get the liquid off of your counter, because it will NOT just wash off with a sponge, because I tried that first.  It did NOT work! The stain was still there, before I used the Soft Scrub to remove the stain.  Good thing it did work, because Iam a renter, and it left a huge stain!  Why this enery drink would even leave a stain that cannot just be wiped up with wet sponge is a mystery to me, which also makes me question what could be in this drink to make it even do that? That's the big question!<br /><br />The liquid squirted out onto this dish that I keep on my counter which I use for fruit, bread, etc.  Needless to say, the liquid was on the dish, and got into the bread/plastic, so I had to throw that away too.<br /><br />Now onto the flavor.  It's terrible!  It tastes fake,artifical,leaves a weird taste in your mouth, kind of like Hawaiian Punch, but worse!  Good thing I did not use alot of it in my water bottle!

This mechanism, often referred to as self-attention, has been a transformative development in NLP. It serves as a way to allocate \"focus\" or \"attention\" values to the different embedded vectors that pass through the model's embedding layer. This allocation is achieved by segmenting the input vectors into three key components: queries, keys, and values.**\n","\n","**The process begins with the transformation of the input embeddings into three distinct matrices: the Query matrix (Q), Key matrix (K), and Value matrix (V). These matrices are obtained through linear transformations of the original embeddings.**\n","\n","**The heart of the attention mechanism involves calculating dot products between the Query matrix and the Transposed Key matrix. The resulting dot products are then scaled by the square root of the dimension of the key vectors. This scaling factor plays a crucial role in maintaining stable gradients during training.**\n","\n","**The next step in the process employs a softmax operation on the scaled dot products. The softmax function normalizes the values, converting them into attention weights. These attention weights indicate the \"importance\" or \"weight\" assigned to each word in relation to the others. The summation of the attention weights for each query-key pair ensures that the model focuses on the most relevant information.**\n","\n","**The weighted sum of the Value matrix, determined by the attention weights, generates an attended representation. In essence, the attention mechanism enables the model to capture the contextual relationships between words, determining how much each word contributes to the overall understanding of the sequence.**\n","\n","**One innovation that distinguishes the Transformer architecture is multi-head attention. Instead of relying on a single attention mechanism, multiple parallel attention mechanisms, or \"heads,\" are employed. Each head attends to the input independently and learns different aspects of the relationships between words.

Positional encoding is a technique used to inject information about the relative or absolute position of tokens in a sequence into the input embeddings.\n","\n","Here's a breakdown of what the code does:\n","\n","1. The `PositionalEncoding` class is defined as a subclass of `nn.Module`, indicating that it is a PyTorch module.\n","\n","2. The `__init__` method is the constructor of the class and takes three parameters:\n","   - `d_model`: The dimensionality of the model (embedding size).\n","   - `dropout`: The dropout probability for regularization.\n","   - `seq_len`: The maximum sequence length.\n","\n","3. Inside the constructor:\n","   - A dropout layer is created using `nn.Dropout` with the specified dropout probability.\n","   - A tensor `position` is created using `torch.arange(seq_len).unsqueeze(1)`, representing the positions from 0 to `seq_len-1`.\n","   - A tensor `div_term` is computed using `torch.exp(torch.arange(0, d_model, 2) * (-math.log(10000.0) / d_model))`, which is used to create a geometric progression of frequencies.\n","   - A tensor `pe` (positional encoding) is initialized with zeros of shape `(seq_len, 1, d_model)`.\n","   - The odd indices of `pe` are filled with the sine of the position multiplied by the corresponding `div_term` value.\n","   - The even indices of `pe` are filled with the cosine of the position multiplied by the corresponding `div_term` value.\n","   - The `pe` tensor is registered as a buffer of the module using `self.register_buffer('pe', pe)`, so that it is saved and loaded with the module's state dict.\n","\n","4. The `forward` method is defined to compute the output of the positional encoding module:\n","   - It takes an input tensor `x` of shape `[seq_len, batch_size, embedding_dim]`.\n","   - The positional encoding tensor `pe` is added to the input tensor `x` element-wise, broadcasting the positional encoding to match the shape of `x`.\n","   - The resulting tensor is passed through the dropout layer and returned as the output.\n","\n","In summary, the `PositionalEncoding` module adds positional information to the input embeddings of a transformer model. It creates a fixed positional encoding tensor based on sine and cosine functions of different frequencies, which is added to the input embeddings.

attention allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously, capturing multiple relationships and dependencies.\n","\n","Let's break down the code:\n","\n","1. The `MultiHeadedAttention` class is defined as a subclass of `nn.Module`, indicating that it is a PyTorch module.\n","\n","2. The `__init__` method is the constructor of the class and takes three parameters:\n","   - `h`: The number of attention heads.\n","   - `d_model`: The dimensionality of the model (embedding size).\n","   - `dropout`: The dropout probability for regularization.\n","\n","3. Inside the constructor:\n","   - The dimension of each attention head `d_k` is calculated as `d_model // h`.\n","   - Four linear layers are created using `nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)` and stored in `self.linears` as a `nn.ModuleList`. These linear layers are used for transforming the query, key, value, and output.\n","   - A dropout layer is created using `nn.Dropout` with the specified dropout probability.\n","\n","4. The `scaled_dot_product_attention` method is defined as a static method to compute the scaled dot-product attention:\n","   - It takes the query, key, value, and optional mask and dropout as input.\n","   - The dot product of the query and key is computed using `torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1))`, and then scaled by dividing by the square root of `d_k`.\n","   - If a mask is provided, the scores are masked by setting the masked positions to negative infinity using `scores.masked_fill(mask == 0, float('-inf'))`.\n","   - The attention weights are computed by applying a softmax function to the scores using `torch.softmax(scores, dim=-1)`.\n","   - If dropout is provided, it is applied to the attention weights.\n","   - The attended values are computed by multiplying the attention weights with the value using `torch.matmul(p_attn, value)`.\n","   - The method returns the attended values and the attention weights.\n","\n","5. The `forward` method is defined to compute the output of the multi-head attention module:\n","   - It takes the query, key, value, and optional mask as input.\n","   - The input tensors are transformed using the linear layers stored in `self.linears`, reshaped to have dimensions `(nbatches, -1, h, d_k)`, and transposed to have dimensions `(nbatches, h, -1, d_k)`.\n","   - The `scaled_dot_product_attention` method is called with the transformed query, key, value, mask, and dropout to compute the attended values and attention weights.\n","   - The attended values are reshaped back to have dimensions `(nbatches, -1, h * d_k)` by transposing and contiguous view.\n","   - The output is obtained by passing the reshaped attended values through the last linear layer in `self.linears`.\n","\n","In summary, the `MultiHeadedAttention` module implements the multi-head attention mechanism, which allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously. It splits the input into multiple attention heads, performs scaled dot-product attention on each head, and then concatenates and transforms the attended values to produce the final output."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"32ce384f","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.024664,"end_time":"2024-05-25T04:13:52.441663","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-05-25T04:13:52.416999","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["![Self-Attention

The hiker is the set of model parameters, which are being updated with each step (iteration). SGD is like the GPS for the hiker, helping it navigate toward the lowest point in the valley (i.e. the global minimum of the loss function) with each step. The key difference is that SGD is an iterative process that updates the parameters in small steps, rather than finding the global minimum in a single shot. The learning rate is essentially the \"speed limit\" for the hiker (the model parameters). The learning rate would be how far the GPS would tell the hiker to go before it iterates/updates. A higher learning rate means that the hiker can make larger updates to the parameters with each step, while a lower learning rate means that the updates are smaller. This is important because it determines not only how quickly the model can find the global minimum, but also how stable the descent is - if the learning rate is too high, the hiker could get lost in the valley, but if it's too low, it could take forever to reach the bottom. So, the learning rate controls the speed of the descent and helps the model find the optimal set of parameters without overshooting or taking too long.\n","\n","Some additional points to augment the analogy:\n","\n","The terrain can be rugged with many hills, valleys, and obstacles - like the high-dimensional, non-convex loss function landscape.\n","\n","Momentum in SGD helps the hiker build up speed in consistently downhill directions, like momentum in GD.\n","\n","Adaptive LR is like the GPS dynamically recommending faster or slower speeds depending on terrain.\n","\n","Regularization is like constraining the hiker's path to stay on trails and avoid dangerous cliffs (to prevent overfitting).\n","\n","Batch size is like the number of hikers traversing together (to average gradient noise).\n","\n","Epochs are like hiking to the bottom, then restarting from the top to repeat the descent.\n","\n","Early stopping is like stopping the hike once you reach a good enough point close to the valley floor.\n","\n","Hyperparameter tuning is like tweaking the GPS settings for optimal navigation.\n","\n","Vanishing gradients are like certain paths becoming too steep or hitting dead-ends.\n","\n","Local minima: The terrain can be rugged with many local minima, which are small valleys that are not as deep as the global minimum. SGD can get stuck in local minima, but there are various techniques that can help to avoid this, such as momentum and adaptive learning rate.\n","\n","Learning rate schedule: The learning rate can be adjusted over time to improve the performance of SGD. This is known as a learning rate schedule. For example, the learning rate can be decreased as the model converges to the global minimum, in order to prevent overshooting.\n","\n","Noise: The gradient calculation can be noisy, especially when the batch size is small. This can cause SGD to take a more erratic path towards the global minimum. However, the noise can be averaged out by using a larger batch size."]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"gpu","dataSources":[{"datasetId":6763,"sourceId":9801,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"},{"datasetId":1461623,"sourceId":2415872,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":30527,"isGpuEnabled":true,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.12"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":8430.272887,"end_time":"2024-05-25T04:30:33.745218","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2024-05-25T02:10:03.472331","version":"2.4.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
